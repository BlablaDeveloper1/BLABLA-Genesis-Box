# BLABLA-Genesis-Box

BlaBla is a SocialFi project created by former members of the TikTok and Meta teams. lt is led by investment from Morse and isthe first DAPP in the Morse ecosystem.
At BlaBla, we break the boundaries of traditional video platforms by implementing a decentralized model and a transparentreward system, allowing every user and creator to receive their fair share.
Users earn tokens through watching, interacting, and sharing content, while creators benefit from direct tips provided by users.

The Genesis Box is a precious gift to earlysupporters.
The design philosophy behind the Genesis Box is to express deepgratitude to every early supporter and invite them to become co.creators of this new era.
